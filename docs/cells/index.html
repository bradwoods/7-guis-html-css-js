      <h2>Challenge:</h2>
      <p>Change propagation, widget customization, implementing a more authentic/involved GUI application.</p>
      <h2>Criteria:</h2>
      <ul id="criteria">
        <li>Create a simple but usable spreadsheet application.</li>
        <li>The spreadsheet should be scrollable.</li>
        <li>The rows should be numbered from 0 to 99 and the columns from A to Z.</li>
        <li>Double-clicking a cell C lets the user change C’s formula.</li>
        <li>
          After having finished editing the formula is parsed and evaluated and its updated value is shown in C. In
          addition, all cells which depend on C must be re-evaluated. This process repeats until there are no more
          changes in the values of any cell (change propagation).
        </li>
        <li>
          One should not just recompute the value of every cell but only of those cells that depend on another cell’s
          changed value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cells is a more authentic and involved task that tests if a particular approach also scales to a somewhat bigger
        application. The two primary GUI-related challenges are intelligent propagation of changes and widget
        customization. Admittedly, there is a substantial part that is not necessarily very GUI-related but that is just
        the nature of a more authentic challenge. A good solution’s change propagation will not involve much effort and
        the customization of a widget should not prove too difficult. The domain-specific code is clearly separated from
        the GUI-specific code. The resulting spreadsheet widget is reusable.

      <p>
        Cells is directly inspired by the
        <a href="https://www.artima.com/pins1ed/the-scells-spreadsheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >SCells spreadsheet example</a
        >
        from the book Programming in Scala. Please refer to the book (or the implementations in this repository) for
        more details especially with respect to the not directly GUI-related concerns like parsing and evaluating
        formulas and the precise syntax and semantics of the spreadsheet language.
