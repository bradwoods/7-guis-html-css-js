      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Constraints.</p>
      <p>
        The task is to build a frame containing a combobox C with the two options “one-way flight” and “return flight”,
        two textfields T1 and T2 representing the start and return date, respectively, and a button B for submitting the
        selected flight. T2 is enabled if C’s value is “return flight”. When C has the value “return flight” and T2’s
        date is strictly before T1’s then B is disabled. When a non-disabled textfield T has an ill-formatted date then
        T is colored red and B is disabled. When clicking B a message is displayed informing the user of his selection
        (e.g. “You have booked a one-way flight on 04.04.2014.”). Initially, C has the value “one-way flight” and T1 as
        well as T2 have the same (arbitrary) date (it is implied that T2 is disabled).

        The focus of Flight Booker lies on modelling constraints between widgets on the one hand and modelling
        constraints within a widget on the other hand. Such constraints are very common in everyday interactions with
        GUI applications. A good solution for Flight Booker will make the constraints clear, succinct and explicit in
        the source code and not hidden behind a lot of scaffolding.
      </p>

        Flight Booker is directly inspired by the Flight Booking Java example in Sodium with the simplification of using
        textfields for date input instead of specialized date picking widgets as the focus of Flight Booker is not on
        specialized/custom widgets.
